### TODO

lobby (Sal)
  - Styled header with user info and logout button
  - Styled "Create Game" form
  - Styled game list (showing games from database)
  - Styled chat area with message list and input (if implementing messages)

Game page (Kien)
  - IMPORTANT: Create a visual mock-up of your game's playing interface
      Show how the game will look during actual gameplay
      Include placeholders for game elements (cards, board, pieces, etc.)
      This will become the template for your game functionality later
      Doesn't need to be pixel-perfect - rough mock-up is fine
      Focus on layout and visual structure, not perfect alignment
  - Consistent header styling
  - Clear game information display (from database)
  - Navigation back to lobby

Login/signup pages (Bao)
  - Centered form layout
  - Clear labels and inputs
  - Styled submit button
  - Styled error messages (if present)
  - Link to alternate page (login ↔ signup)

Db test page (John)
  - Render contents from all tables in DB
